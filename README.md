Hi 👋🏾, I'm El-hanan Garba, a passionate and versatile individual with an excellent understanding of platforms for effective data analysis, including SQL, spreadsheets, Tableau, Power BI, Python, AI, and cloud computing (AWS, Azure).  

Through academic projects, personal work, and hands-on training, I've gained experience collecting, cleaning, transforming, organizing, and visualizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions and uncover meaningful insights. I also possess strong problem-solving, communication, organizational, and analytical skills.  

Let's connect and explore the power of data together!
